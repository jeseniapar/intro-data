### Analyzing NCVS Data:
  - The National Crimes Survey (NCVS) has been collecting data on personal and household victimization since 1973 through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses. Administered by the U.S. Census Bureau on behalf of the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the survey aims to (1) develop detailed information about crime victims and consequences, (2) estimate the numbers and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) provide uniform measures of selected crime types, and (4) enable comparisons over time and across different areas. The NCVS is a retrospective observational study of households across America, involving interviews with randomly sampled households screened for victimization over a six-month period preceding the interview. The sampling process employs a stratified, multi-stage cluster design, drawing approximately 200,000 sample housing units from the decennial census. The cleaned dataset encompasses 81 variables, including indicators like COLLEGE (whether the household is on a college campus), SEX (the interviewee's sex), JOB (the interviewee's occupation), and NUM_INCIDENTS (the number of reported incidents by the household). With 8,043 rows or observations, it represents instances of interviews conducted with 1,925 distinct households identified using unique IDHHs. Notably, there may be more repeats than expected, potentially exceeding the codebook's maximum limit of three repeats for a single household. Despite concerns about bias due to an overall response rate of 56.4 percent in the 2020 NCVS, nonresponse bias analysis and weighted data adjustments aim to correct for potential differences among demographic subgroups, balancing variance and reducing sampling and selection bias.
 
### Using World Development Indicators to predict Happiness
  - Combined variables from two large datasets, the World Bankâ€™s World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset and the World Happiness Report (WHR) from the Sustainable Development Solutions Network. This combination allowed us to leverage specific variables related to the social, political, and economic condition of each country and explore their correlation with the happiness, mental well-being, and attitudes of its citizens. Through a multifaceted approach, our project aimed to uncover the intricate relationships between demographic trends, economic health, labor market conditions, governance quality, and their collective impact on national happiness levels.
